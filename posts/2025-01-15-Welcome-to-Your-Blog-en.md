# Welcome to Your Blog! ðŸŽ‰

Congratulations on setting up your blog with **blog-starter-rs**!

## Getting Started

This is a sample post to help you understand how to create content. You can:

1. Edit this post to make it your own
2. Delete it and create new posts
3. Use it as a template for future posts

## Writing Posts

Posts are written in **Markdown** and support:

- **Bold** and *italic* text
- Lists (like this one!)
- Code blocks
- Images
- And much more!

### Code Example

Here's a simple Rust example:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

### Adding Images

You can add images by placing them in the `public/` directory:

```markdown
![Alt text](/path/to/image.png)
```

## What's Next?

1. **Customize the About page** - Edit `src/components/about_page.rs`
2. **Set up Giscus comments** - Follow the guide in `docs/giscus-setup-guide.md`
3. **Write your first post** - Create a new file in `posts/` directory
4. **Deploy your blog** - See README.md for deployment options
